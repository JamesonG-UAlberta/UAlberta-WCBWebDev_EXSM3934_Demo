          <h2>The Purpose of Responsive Design</h2>
          <p>Responsive design allows HTML pages and their designs to scale or completely reorganize to better suit different screen sizes.
            For example, on a mobile device, forms may be laid out in a single column, versus on a large desktop screen they may be in two or three columns.
            We can also change font sizes to be more readable, change menu styles into a collapsable format, and many other things to make a website mobile-friendly.
